@brief   This module is contains the Vehicle class, which is the main entry 
         point for using the Python library to access vehicle data 
         programatically. Most users will want to interact with an instance of 
         Vehicle, and won't need to deal with other parts of the library 
         directly (besides measurement types)."""

class Vehicle(object):
    """The Vehicle class is the main entry point for the OpenXC Python library.
    A Vehicle represents a connection to at least one vehicle data source and
    zero or 1 vehicle controllers, which can accept commands to send back to the
    vehicle. A Vehicle instance can have more than one data source (e.g. if the
    computer using this library has a secondary GPS data source).

    Most applications will either request synchronous vehicle data measurements
    using the ``get`` method or or with a callback function passed to
    ``listen``.

    More advanced applications that want access to all raw vehicle data may want
    to register a ``DataSink`` with a Vehicle.

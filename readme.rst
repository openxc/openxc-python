--

The OpenXC Python library (for Python 2.6 or higher) provides an alternative
interface to vehicle data from the OpenXC Platform. The primary platform for
OpenXC applications is Android, but for prototyping and testing, often it is
preferrable to use a low-overhead environment like Python when developing.

In addition to a port of the Android library API, the package also contains a
number of command-line tools for connecting to the CAN translator and
manipulating previously recorded vehicle data.
